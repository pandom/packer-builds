# Packer Builds

This is the formation of a repository that will include various Packer Builds. This is subject to change.

The end result will be building consistent images of Ubuntu, Windows, RHEL, and other images across GCP, Azure, AWS, vSphere, and Hyper-V. This will be backed by GitHub Actions and HCP Packer.
